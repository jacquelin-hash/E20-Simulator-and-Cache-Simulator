# E20-Simulator-and-Cache-Simulator

## Overview 
The E20 Simulator replicates the behavior of an E20 processor by executing E20 machine language instructions in software. Additionally, the Cache Simulator monitors memory access patterns, providing insights into how the simulated program interacts with memory.

# Features 
  -E20 Machine Language Execution: Simulates the full instruction set as described in the E20 manual.  
  -Cache Simulation: Tracks memory access, hits, misses, and cache updates.

# Getting Started 
  - A C/C++ compiler (or the appropriate compiler for the programming language used).
  - Familiarity with machine language and memory caching principles.
